# my-Repository-Traffic
want to create a Git Action scheduler that allows me to view the traffic for all of my repositories for a day or two weeks.

Is it not too inconvenient to have to go into the traffic for each repository to check?

I want to automate this process using API and Action scheduler.

The goal is to rank the repositories by daily changes, daily visitors and cloners, and compare the data from the past two weeks.

With this data, I can see which of my repositories are the most popular and also check the trend.

## how to use

1. fork
2. In the settings, I will register a GitHub token under the name **MY_TRAFFIC_TOKEN**.
